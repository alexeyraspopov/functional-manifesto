# The Functional Manifesto

Modern web libs and frameworks give us a lot of abstractions that *should* help us to develop systems. These abstractions create the issue of developer's communication: we are speaking on different languages while trying to do the same things and solve the same problems. That's why we need complete glossary.

> For that reason we should do (as wise programmers aware of our limitations) our utmost to shorten the conceptual gap between the static program and the dynamic process, to make the correspondence between the program (spread out in text space) and the process (spread out in time) as trivial as possible. (Edsger W. Dijkstra, 1968)

> The art of programming is the art of organizing complexity, of mastering multitude and avoiding its bastard chaos as effectively as possible. (Edsger W. Dijkstra, 1970)

> There is no certainty in sciences where one of the mathematical sciences cannot be applied, or which are not in relation with these mathematics. (Leonardo da Vinci)
